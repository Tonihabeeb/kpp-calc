## Issue Resolution Summary

### Resolved Issues
1. **Port 9103 Conflict:** Resolved by proper process cleanup and restart
2. **Service Manager Issues:** Bypassed by manual service startup
3. **Dash Frontend Timeout:** Resolved by foreground startup and monitoring
4. **Process Cleanup:** Achieved clean environment for all services

### Lessons Learned
- Manual service startup more reliable than automated manager for troubleshooting
- Port conflicts can persist due to Windows networking behavior
- Foreground startup provides better error visibility
- Regular health checks essential for system monitoring

## Next Steps
