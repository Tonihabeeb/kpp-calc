Automatic Venting System for KPP Pneumatic Floaters

This module implements Phase 4 of the pneumatics upgrade:
- Passive venting mechanisms based on floater position
- Air release dynamics and pressure equalization
- Water refill process for floater reset to heavy state
- Integration with position detection and chain control

Key Physics:
- Rapid pressure drop to atmospheric when venting triggered
- Water inflow rates through floater openings
- Buoyancy state transitions during venting
- Geometric triggers for automatic valve opening
