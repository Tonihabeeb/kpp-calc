Pressure expansion physics for pneumatic floater system.

This module handles:
- Gas expansion models (isothermal vs adiabatic)
- Pressure equalization during ascent
- Volume changes and buoyancy effects
- Gas dissolution/release in water (Henry's law)

Phase 3 of pneumatics upgrade implementation.
