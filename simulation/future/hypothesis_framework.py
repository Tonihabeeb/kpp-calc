Future Enhancement Framework for KPP Simulation System

This module provides the foundation for implementing H1, H2, and H3
hypotheses as future enhancements to the core simulation system.

The framework is designed to:
1. Maintain backward compatibility with current implementation
2. Provide standardized interfaces for new physics models
3. Enable gradual integration of advanced features
4. Support A/B testing between different approaches
