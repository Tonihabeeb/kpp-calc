# Stage 1 Implementation Completion Report

## Overview
Stage 1 of the KPP Simulation upgrade has been **successfully implemented and tested**. The core physics engine refactoring is complete and fully functional.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### ✅ Core Physics Engine (`simulation/physics/physics_engine.py`)
- **Proper time-stepping simulation loop** - Euler integration with configurable time steps
- **Comprehensive force calculations** for each floater:
  - Buoyant force: `F_B = ρ_water × V × g`
  - Gravitational force: `F_W = m × g` (state-dependent mass)
  - Hydrodynamic drag: `F_D = 0.5 × ρ_water × C_d × A × v²`
- **Chain constraint dynamics** - All floaters move with unified chain velocity
- **Generator load integration** - Convert torque to equivalent force: `F_gen = τ_gen / R`
- **Energy tracking** - Electrical power output: `P_out = τ_gen × ω`

### ✅ Event Handler (`simulation/physics/event_handler.py`) 
- **Precise state transitions** - Air injection at bottom, venting at top
- **Energy accounting** - Compression energy: `W_inject = P_depth × V_air`
- **Zone-based detection** - Angular zones for injection/venting events
- **Duplicate prevention** - Prevents multiple events per floater per cycle

### ✅ Floater Component Enhancement (`simulation/components/floater.py`)
- **State management** - "light" (air-filled) vs "heavy" (water-filled) states
- **Mass properties** - Dynamic mass based on fill state
- **Angular position** - `angle` and `theta` properties for chain positioning
- **Compatibility methods** - `is_ascending()`, `set_theta()` for physics engine

### ✅ Main Simulation Integration (`simulation/engine.py`)
- **Refactored simulation loop** - Uses new physics engine as primary calculation method
- **Event handling integration** - Processes injection/venting events each step
