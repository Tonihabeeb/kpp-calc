# KPP SIMULATOR CRASH ANALYSIS REPORT

## ðŸš¨ ACTUAL ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

### Problem 1: Multiple Infinite Loops in Flask App (CRITICAL)
- **Line 78-92**: `analyze_data()` function runs `while True:` loop
- **Line 323-353**: `analyze_real_time_data()` function runs `while True:` loop  
- **Line 119-147**: `event_stream()` in `/stream` endpoint runs `while True:` loop

These loops can **block the Flask main thread** causing timeouts.

### Problem 2: Real-time File I/O Operations (HIGH)
- **Line 128-134**: Writing CSV files during streaming
- **Line 119**: Creating files in real-time during requests
- File I/O operations **block the Flask response thread**

### Problem 3: Poor Thread Synchronization (HIGH)
- Multiple background threads accessing shared resources
- No proper locking on `engine.data_queue` access
- Race conditions between analysis threads and engine

### Problem 4: Unsafe Engine Access (MEDIUM)
- **Line 277**: `with engine.data_queue.mutex:` without null checks
- Many endpoints access `engine` without verifying it exists
- No error handling for engine state transitions

### Problem 5: Memory Leaks (MEDIUM)
- **Line 74-75**: Unbounded deques collecting data
- Continuous CSV writing without rotation
- Queue operations without cleanup

## ðŸ”§ REQUIRED FIXES

### Fix 1: Remove Blocking Loops from Flask Thread
- Move analysis loops to separate processes
- Use async operations instead of `while True:`
- Implement proper thread pools

### Fix 2: Eliminate Real-time File I/O
- Remove CSV writing from `/stream` endpoint
- Use in-memory caching with periodic saves
- Implement background file operations

### Fix 3: Implement Proper Thread Safety
- Add proper locks around shared resources
- Use thread-safe queues
- Implement graceful engine access patterns

### Fix 4: Add Comprehensive Error Handling
- Null checks before engine operations
- Graceful degradation when engine unavailable
- Proper exception handling in all endpoints

### Fix 5: Implement Resource Management
- Bounded data collections
- Automatic cleanup of old data
- Proper queue size limits

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

1. **Disable problematic background threads**
2. **Remove file I/O from real-time endpoints**
3. **Add null checks for engine access**
4. **Implement proper error boundaries**
5. **Test with simplified Flask app**

## ðŸ’¡ WHY PARAMETER REDUCTION HELPED TEMPORARILY

Reducing parameters didn't fix the root cause - it just:
- Reduced data volume (less queue pressure)
- Simplified calculations (faster processing)
- Made blocking operations shorter

But the **architectural problems remain** and will cause crashes again.
