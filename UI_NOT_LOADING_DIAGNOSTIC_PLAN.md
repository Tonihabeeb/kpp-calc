# Aggressive Diagnostic & Fix Plan: Dash UI Not Loading

## 1. Possible Causes

### A. Backend Issues
- Backend not running or crashed after startup.
- Port mismatch: Dash app is trying to reach the backend on the wrong port.
- CORS issues: Frontend requests blocked by browser.
- API endpoint errors: Frontend expects endpoints (e.g., `/data/summary`, `/parameters`, `/status`) that are missing or returning errors.
- Simulation not running: Backend is up, but simulation loop is not producing data.
- Backend stuck in a loop or deadlock: No responses to API calls.

### B. Frontend (Dash) Issues
- Dash app not running or crashed after startup.
- Dash app running on wrong port or not accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8051`.
- Frontend code errors: Syntax errors, missing imports, or callback exceptions.
- Frontend cannot reach backend: Wrong `BACKEND_URL`, network issues, or CORS.
- Infinite loading due to failed API calls: If the Dash app is waiting for data that never arrives or gets errors.
- JavaScript errors: Preventing UI from rendering.

### C. Environment/Dependency Issues
- Missing or incompatible Python packages.
- Multiple Python environments: Backend and frontend running in different environments.
- File permission issues: Preventing logs, sockets, or data files from being accessed.

### D. Browser/Network Issues
- Browser cache: Old JS/CSS causing issues.
- Firewall/Antivirus: Blocking local ports.
- Wrong URL: Typo or wrong port in browser.

## 2. Aggressive Diagnostic Plan

### Step 1: Backend Health
- Confirm backend is running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5001/status`.
- Check backend logs for errors after startup and during frontend access.
- Test all expected API endpoints (`/data/summary`, `/parameters`, `/status`, etc.) directly in browser or with `curl`.

### Step 2: Frontend Health
- Confirm Dash app is running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8051`.
- Check Dash app logs for errors or stack traces.
- Open browser dev tools (F12) and check for:
  - Network errors (failed API calls, CORS errors, 404/500s).
  - JavaScript errors in the console.

### Step 3: API Connectivity
- Check if the Dash app's `BACKEND_URL` is set correctly and matches the backend port.
- Test API calls from the browser's network tab and see if they succeed or fail.

### Step 4: Simulation Data Flow
- Confirm simulation is running and producing data (check logs for real-time updates).
- Check if the backend is returning valid data (not empty or error) for summary endpoints.

### Step 5: Environment Consistency
- Confirm both backend and frontend are using the same Python environment.
- Check for missing dependencies (`pip freeze` and compare with `requirements.txt`).

### Step 6: Browser/Network
- Clear browser cache or try incognito mode.
- Try a different browser.
- Confirm no firewall/antivirus is blocking local ports.

## 3. Proposed Aggressive Fix Plan

1. **Backend:**
   - Test `/status` and all API endpoints directly.
   - Check backend logs for errors after frontend tries to load.
   - Restart backend with debug logging enabled.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Restart Dash app with debug mode.
   - Check logs for errors.
   - Open browser dev tools, check network and console for errors.

3. **API/Network:**
   - Use browser/curl/Postman to test all API endpoints.
   - Confirm CORS headers are present.

4. **Simulation:**
   - Manually trigger simulation start if needed.
   - Check if data is being produced and returned.

5. **Environment:**
   - Run `pip freeze` and compare with `requirements.txt`.
   - Reinstall all dependencies if needed.

6. **Browser:**
   - Clear cache, try incognito, or another browser.
