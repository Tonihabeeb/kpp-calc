# KPP Simulation Dashboard: Performance & Real-Time UI Upgrade Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a step-by-step plan to improve the performance, user experience, and real-time responsiveness of the KPP simulation dashboard. The plan is divided into backend, frontend, and advanced (WebSocket) upgrade tracks.

---

## 1. Backend Performance Improvements

### 1.1. Profile and Optimize Simulation Step
- **Action:** Profile the simulation loop and `/data/summary` endpoint to identify bottlenecks.
- **Goal:** Reduce response time to <0.5s per request.
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] Add timing logs around simulation step and data serialization.
  - Optimize any slow calculations or unnecessary data copying.

### 1.2. Decouple Simulation and API
- **Action:** Ensure simulation runs in a separate thread/process from the API server.
- **Goal:** API should always return the latest data instantly.
- **Tasks:**
  - Refactor if simulation and API are blocking each other.
  - Use thread-safe queues or shared memory for data exchange.

### 1.3. Efficient Data Transfer
- **Action:** Minimize the size of data sent to the frontend.
- **Goal:** Only send required fields, avoid large or redundant payloads.
- **Tasks:**
  - Audit `/data/summary` output fields.
  - Remove or compress any large, unused, or redundant data.

## 2. Frontend/UI Upgrades

### 2.1. Increase Update Frequency
- **Action:** Lower the Dash `Interval` component to 200-500ms.
- **Goal:** Smoother, more real-time UI updates.
- **Tasks:**
  - Adjust interval in Dash layout.
  - Monitor for browser or backend overload.

### 2.2. Live Graphs and Metrics
- **Action:** Add real-time updating graphs for key metrics (torque, power, efficiency, etc.).
- **Goal:** Visualize system behavior live.
- **Tasks:**
  - Use `dcc.Graph` with `extendData` for efficient updates.
  - Add controls to select which metrics to display.

### 2.3. Enhanced Status and Controls
- **Action:** Improve status badges and add more control buttons.
- **Goal:** Better user feedback and control.
- **Tasks:**
  - Color-coded badges for system health, simulation state, errors.
  - Add Pause/Resume, Reset, and parameter adjustment controls.
  - Show notifications for errors or important events.

### 2.4. Responsive and Modern Layout
- **Action:** Refine dashboard layout for usability and mobile-friendliness.
- **Goal:** Professional, accessible UI.
- **Tasks:**
  - Use Dash Bootstrap Components for layout.
  - Test on different screen sizes.

## 3. Advanced: True Real-Time Updates (WebSockets)

### 3.1. Evaluate WebSocket Integration
- **Action:** Research Dash Extensions WebSocket or Flask-SocketIO.
- **Goal:** Push updates from backend to frontend instantly.
- **Tasks:**
  - Prototype a simple WebSocket push from backend to Dash.
  - Compare with polling for performance and reliability.

### 3.2. Implement WebSocket Data Push
- **Action:** Replace or supplement polling with WebSocket updates.
- **Goal:** Achieve sub-200ms latency for UI updates.
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate Flask-SocketIO or Dash Extensions WebSocket.
  - Update frontend to listen for and render pushed data.

## 4. Prioritization & Milestones

1. **Backend Profiling & Optimization** (High Priority)
2. **Frontend Update Frequency & Live Graphs** (High Priority)
3. **UI/UX Enhancements** (Medium Priority)
4. **WebSocket Real-Time Push** (Advanced, Optional)

## 5. Next Steps
- Review and discuss this plan.
- Assign tasks and set milestones.
- Begin with backend profiling and frontend update interval adjustments.
- Iterate and test improvements at each stage.
