# Contributing Guidelines

- Follow PEP8 for code style (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants).
- Use type hints and docstrings for all public classes and functions.
- Run `black .` before committing to auto-format code.
- Run `flake8` to check for linting errors.
- Add tests for new features in the `tests/` directory.
