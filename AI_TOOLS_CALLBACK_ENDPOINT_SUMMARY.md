```

#### 2. Endpoint Analysis
```python
# DeepSource can identify:
- Missing error handling in endpoints (21 found)

    ],
    "debugging_focus": [
        "Callback execution chains",
        "Endpoint response patterns", 
        "Error propagation",
        "Performance bottlenecks"
    ]
}
```

### Workik Commands for Callback/Endpoint Analysis
```python
# Analyze callback performance
workik.analyze_performance("simulation.engine.SimulationEngine.step")

# Map callback dependencies
workik.map_dependencies("app.py:start_simulation")

breakpoint_2 = "simulation.engine.SimulationEngine.step()"
breakpoint_3 = "app.py:data_live()"

# Workik AI suggestions:
- "Callback chain has 5 steps, consider breaking into smaller functions"
- "Step 3 is taking 150ms, optimize physics calculations"
- "Missing error handling between steps 2 and 3"
```

```python
# Monitor endpoint performance:
workik.monitor_endpoint("/data/live")

# Workik AI insights:
