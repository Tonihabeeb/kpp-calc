# Bug Fixes Report

## Overview
I identified and fixed 3 significant bugs in the codebase, addressing memory leaks, security vulnerabilities, and race conditions.

## Bug 1: Memory Leak in WebSocket Listener Management

### **Problem Description**
- **Location**: `main.py`, `SimulationCore` class
- **Type**: Memory Leak / Performance Issue
- **Severity**: High

The WebSocket listener management system had several critical issues:

1. **Memory Leak**: Failed WebSocket connections were not properly cleaned up from the `self.listeners` list
2. **Unbounded Growth**: No limit on the number of concurrent listeners, allowing potential memory exhaustion
3. **Unsafe Iteration**: The `broadcast()` method iterated over the listeners list while it could be modified concurrently

### **Root Cause**
```python
# Original problematic code:
def broadcast(self):
    for queue in self.listeners:  # Unsafe iteration
        try:
            queue.put_nowait(self.state.dict())
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Broadcast failed: {e}")
            # BUG: Failed listeners were never removed!
```

### **Fix Applied**
1. **Automatic Cleanup**: Failed listeners are automatically removed during broadcast
2. **Bounds Checking**: Limited concurrent listeners to 100 to prevent memory exhaustion
3. **Thread Safety**: Added proper locking mechanisms
4. **Safe Iteration**: Creates a copy of the list before iteration

```python
# Fixed code:
def broadcast(self):
    # Clean up disconnected listeners to prevent memory leaks
    active_listeners = []
    for queue in self.listeners[:]:  # Create a copy to iterate safely
        try:
            queue.put_nowait(self.state.dict())
            active_listeners.append(queue)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Broadcast failed, removing listener: {e}")
            # Don't add failed listeners to active list (auto-cleanup)
    
    # Update listeners list with only active ones
    with self.lock:
        self.listeners = active_listeners
```

### **Impact**
- ✅ Prevents memory leaks from orphaned WebSocket connections
- ✅ Protects against DoS attacks via connection flooding
- ✅ Improves system stability and performance

## Bug 2: Security Vulnerability - Overly Permissive CORS Configuration

### **Problem Description**
- **Location**: `main.py`, CORS middleware configuration
- **Type**: Security Vulnerability
- **Severity**: Critical

The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration was dangerously permissive:

```python
# DANGEROUS original configuration:
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],        # ❌ Allows ANY website to access the API
    allow_credentials=True,     # ❌ Enables credential sharing with any origin
    allow_methods=["*"],        # ❌ Allows all HTTP methods
    allow_headers=["*"],        # ❌ Allows all headers
)
```

### **Security Risks**
1. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Any malicious website could make requests to the API
2. **Data Exposure**: Sensitive simulation data could be accessed by unauthorized domains
3. **Credential Theft**: Cookies and authentication tokens could be stolen
4. **API Abuse**: External sites could overload the simulation service

### **Fix Applied**
Implemented secure CORS configuration with:

1. **Specific Origin Allowlist**: Only trusted domains can access the API
2. **Environment-Based Configuration**: Production origins can be configured via environment variables
3. **Limited Methods**: Only necessary HTTP methods are allowed
4. **Restricted Headers**: Only required headers are permitted

```python
# Secure configuration:
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",  # React dev server
    "http://localhost:8000",  # Local development
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
    "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
]

# Get allowed origins from environment variable for production
import os
if origins_env := os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS"):
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS = origins_env.split(",")

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],  # Specific methods only
    allow_headers=["Content-Type", "Authorization"],  # Specific headers only
)
```

### **Impact**
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized cross-origin access
- ✅ Protects against CSRF attacks
- ✅ Enables secure production deployment
- ✅ Maintains development flexibility

## Bug 3: Race Condition and Configuration Inconsistency

### **Problem Description**
- **Location**: `main.py`, `SimulationCore` class and `SimulationConfig`
- **Type**: Race Condition + Logic Error
- **Severity**: Medium-High

Two related issues were identified:

#### 3a. Race Condition in Threading
The `_run_loop()` method accessed the `self.running` flag without proper synchronization:

```python
# Original problematic code:
def _run_loop(self):
    while not self._stop_event.is_set():
        if self.running:  # ❌ Race condition: unsynchronized access
            self.tick()
            self.broadcast()
        time.sleep(0.1)  # ❌ Blocking sleep prevents immediate shutdown
```

#### 3b. Duplicate Configuration Fields
The `SimulationConfig` model had conflicting air pressure definitions:

```python
# Conflicting configuration:
class SimulationConfig(BaseModel):
    airPressure: float = 3.0      # ❌ Inconsistent naming and value
    air_pressure: float = 300000  # ❌ Duplicate field with different value
```

### **Root Cause**
1. **Race Condition**: Multiple threads could read/write `self.running` simultaneously
2. **Configuration Confusion**: Two fields for the same concept with vastly different values (3.0 vs 300000)

### **Fix Applied**

#### 3a. Threading Fix
```python
def _run_loop(self):
    while not self._stop_event.is_set():
        # Check running state with proper synchronization
        with self.lock:
            should_run = self.running
        
        if should_run:
            self.tick()
            self.broadcast()
        
        # Use the stop event for sleeping to enable immediate shutdown
        self._stop_event.wait(timeout=0.1)
```

#### 3b. Configuration Fix
```python
class SimulationConfig(BaseModel):
    num_floaters: int = 8
    floater_volume: float = 0.3
    floater_mass_empty: float = 18.0
    floater_area: float = 0.035
    # Fixed: Remove duplicate air pressure fields, use consistent naming
    air_pressure: float = 300000  # Pa (Pascals)
    # ... other fields
```

### **Impact**
- ✅ Eliminates race conditions in thread synchronization
- ✅ Enables immediate and clean shutdown
- ✅ Removes configuration ambiguity
- ✅ Ensures consistent parameter usage

## Summary

| Bug | Type | Severity | Impact | Status |
|-----|------|----------|---------|---------|
| Memory Leak in WebSocket Management | Performance/Memory | High | Memory exhaustion, connection failures | ✅ Fixed |
| Overly Permissive CORS Configuration | Security | Critical | Data exposure, CSRF attacks | ✅ Fixed |
| Race Condition & Config Duplication | Logic/Threading | Medium-High | Inconsistent behavior, race conditions | ✅ Fixed |

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Memory Leak Testing**: Monitor memory usage during extended WebSocket connection cycles
2. **Security Testing**: Verify CORS policies with different origin combinations
3. **Race Condition Testing**: Run simulation under high concurrency to verify thread safety
4. **Configuration Testing**: Validate that air pressure values are used consistently

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
2. **Authentication**: Add proper authentication/authorization
3. **Input Validation**: Enhanced validation for all user inputs
4. **Logging**: Add security event logging for monitoring

All fixes have been applied and the system is now more secure, performant, and reliable.
