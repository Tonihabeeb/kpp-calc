# KPP Simulator Terminal Script Improvement Plan
Based on my review of start_sync_system.ps1, here's a comprehensive to-do list for improvements:

## üîß **Critical Fixes (High Priority)**

### 1. Fix Process Management Issues
- [x] **Fix `$_.CommandLine` error** - Replace with proper PowerShell process filtering
- [x] **Implement proper process detection** using Get-CimInstance or Get-WmiObject
- [x] **Add process validation** before stopping to prevent killing wrong processes
- [x] **Create process tracking** to maintain list of started processes

**Implementation Notes:**
- Fixed the `$_.CommandLine` issue by using proper PowerShell process filtering
- Used `Get-Process` with `-Name` parameter and additional filtering
- Added process validation to ensure only KPP-related processes are stopped
- Implemented WMI-based process detection with fallback mechanisms
- Added comprehensive process tracking and validation

### 2. Add Configuration File Support
- [x] **Create config.json** with ports, timeouts, and settings
- [x] **Add configuration validation** on startup
- [x] **Implement config reload capability** (auto-creation of default config)
- [x] **Add environment-specific configs** (dev, staging, prod ready)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created comprehensive `config/kpp_system_config.json` with all system settings
- Added `Load-Configuration` function with validation
- Implemented `Test-Configuration` function for validation
- Auto-creates default configuration if missing
- Supports environment-specific configurations

### 3. Implement Graceful Shutdown
- [x] **Add Ctrl+C handler** with proper cleanup
- [x] **Implement signal handling** for SIGTERM, SIGINT
- [x] **Add shutdown timeout** to prevent hanging
- [x] **Create shutdown sequence** (stop services in reverse order)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Added `Invoke-GracefulShutdown` function with timeout handling
- Implemented event handlers for Ctrl+C and process termination
- Created configurable shutdown sequence based on dependencies
- Added comprehensive cleanup with error handling

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Improvements (High Priority)**

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
- [x] **Validate all URLs** before making requests
- [x] **Sanitize error messages** to prevent injection
- [x] **Add script integrity checks** (checksums framework)
- [x] **Implement safe process execution** with validation

**Implementation Notes:**
- Added `Test-Url` function with comprehensive URL validation
- Implemented `Invoke-ErrorSanitization` for message sanitization
- Created `Test-ScriptExecution` for script validation
- Added security checks for script execution and URL validation

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- [x] **Add error backoff strategy** for repeated failures
- [x] **Implement circuit breaker pattern** for failing services
- [x] **Add error recovery verification** (check if recovery worked)
- [x] **Create error escalation** for critical failures

**Implementation Notes:**
- Added exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern with configurable thresholds
- Added recovery verification with health checks
- Created comprehensive error tracking and escalation

## ‚ö° **Performance Optimizations (Medium Priority)**

### 6. Resource Monitoring Improvements
- [ ] Cache performance counters to reduce overhead
- [ ] Implement adaptive health check intervals based on system load
- [ ] Add performance thresholds with configurable limits
- [ ] Optimize monitoring loop to reduce CPU usage

### 7. Memory Management
- [x] **Implement log rotation** (limit error log size)
- [x] **Add memory cleanup** for long-running sessions
- [x] **Create log file output** in addition to console
- [x] **Add log compression** for historical data

**Implementation Notes:**
- Added structured JSON logging with file rotation
- Implemented in-memory log rotation with configurable limits
- Created log file output with automatic rotation
- Added trace IDs for request tracking
- Implemented proper resource cleanup on shutdown

## üîÑ **Operational Enhancements (Medium Priority)**

### 8. Service Dependency Management
- [ ] Create dependency graph for services
- [ ] Implement startup sequence based on dependencies
- [ ] Add health check dependencies (wait for backend before frontend)
- [ ] Create service restart coordination

### 9. Enhanced Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Add metrics collection (response times, error rates)
- [ ] Implement alerting thresholds with notifications
- [ ] Create health dashboard with real-time status
- [ ] Add performance trending and historical data

### 10. Logging & Observability
- [x] **Implement structured logging** (JSON format)
- [ ] Add log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- [ ] Create log aggregation for multiple instances
- [x] **Add trace IDs** for request tracking

**Implementation Notes:**
- Structured logging implemented with `Write-StructuredLog` function
- Trace IDs implemented in `Write-ErrorLog` function
- Log levels and aggregation still pending

## üéØ **User Experience Improvements (Medium Priority)**

### 11. Interactive Features
- [ ] Add command history for repeated operations
- [ ] Implement auto-completion for commands
- [ ] Create help system with examples
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations

### 12. Status & Reporting
- [ ] Create detailed status reports with metrics
- [ ] Add system health scoring (0-100)
- [ ] Implement trend analysis for performance
- [ ] Create exportable reports (JSON, CSV, HTML)

## üöÄ **Advanced Features (Low Priority)**

### 13. Automation & Orchestration
- [ ] Add scheduled restarts capability
- [ ] Implement rolling updates for zero-downtime
- [ ] Create backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Add disaster recovery procedures

### 14. Integration & APIs
