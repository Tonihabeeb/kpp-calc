# Quality Baseline Report - KPP Simulator

**Generated:** June 28, 2025  
**Phase:** 1 - Tool Integration & Baseline Configs  
**Python Version:** 3.11.2  

## Overview

This document establishes the quality baseline for the KPP Simulator project after implementing Phase 1 of the quality improvement roadmap. All measurements are taken with balanced, production-ready tool configurations.

## Tool Configurations Implemented

### ✅ Static Analysis Tools
- **PyLint** `.pylintrc` - Balanced rules for scientific Python code
- **MyPy** `mypy.ini` - Gradual typing with C-extension support
- **Flake8** - Via pre-commit, style and basic error checking

### ✅ Code Formatting
- **Black** - Code formatting (88 character line length)
- **isort** - Import organization with black compatibility

### ✅ Testing Framework
- **pytest** `pytest.ini` - Test discovery and coverage reporting
- **coverage** - Code coverage measurement (50% minimum target)

### ✅ Quality Gates
- **pre-commit** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Automated quality checks
- **bandit** - Security vulnerability scanning

## Baseline Measurements

### Code Quality Targets

| Metric | Current Target | Future Goal | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Test Coverage** | ≥50% | ≥70% | Start conservative, increase iteratively |
| **PyLint Score** | Error-free | 8.0+ | Focus on errors first, then warnings |
| **MyPy Coverage** | Import-clean | 80%+ | Gradual typing adoption |
| **Security Issues** | 0 high/medium | 0 all | Bandit scanning |

## Quality Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 Deliverables ✅
- [x] Balanced tool configurations for scientific Python
- [x] Pre-commit hooks for automated quality enforcement
- [x] Pytest framework with coverage reporting
- [x] MyPy configuration with gradual typing
- [x] PyLint rules optimized for physics simulation code

### Phase 2 Priorities (Static Analysis)
1. **Type Hints** - Add to high-traffic methods:
   - `SimulationEngine.step()`
   - `Floater.compute_buoyant_force()`
   - `DataLogger` methods (Stage 5)
   
2. **Error Resolution** - Address PyLint/MyPy errors systematically
3. **Import Organization** - Clean up module dependencies

### Phase 3 Priorities (Unit Testing)
1. **Core Physics** - `simulation/components/floater.py`
2. **Engine Integration** - `simulation/engine.py`  
3. **Stage 5 Features** - `simulation/logging/data_logger.py`
4. **API Endpoints** - `routes/export_routes.py`

## Tool Usage Guidelines

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # or activate_dev.bat on Windows

# 2. Format code before committing
black .
isort .

# 3. Check for issues
pylint simulation/ --errors-only
mypy simulation/ --ignore-missing-imports

# 4. Run tests (when available)
pytest tests/

# 5. Pre-commit hooks run automatically on git commit
```

### CI/CD Integration
- Pre-commit hooks enforce formatting and basic checks
- Future: GitHub Actions will run full test suite
- Coverage reports will be generated automatically

## Scientific Code Considerations

### PyLint Disabled Rules
The following PyLint rules are disabled for scientific computing compatibility:
- `too-many-arguments` - Physics functions often need many parameters
- `too-many-locals` - Mathematical calculations use many variables
- `invalid-name` - Scientific notation (x, y, z, dt, etc.) is acceptable
- `import-error` - Handled by MyPy for better C-extension support

### MyPy Configuration
- `ignore_missing_imports = True` - For NumPy/SciPy C extensions
- Gradual typing approach - start with basic checks, add strictness over time
- Per-module configuration for different tolerance levels

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2**: Add type hints to core methods and resolve static analysis issues
2. **Phase 3**: Create comprehensive unit test suite with 70% coverage target  
3. **Phase 4**: Integration tests and API validation
4. **Phase 5**: CI/CD pipeline with automated quality gates

## Quality Metrics Tracking

Future reports will include:
- PyLint score progression
- MyPy type coverage percentage
- Test coverage by module
- Performance regression tracking
- Security vulnerability counts

---

**Note:** This baseline establishes the foundation for systematic quality improvement. The balanced configurations prioritize catching real issues while avoiding noise that would slow development of scientific simulation code.
