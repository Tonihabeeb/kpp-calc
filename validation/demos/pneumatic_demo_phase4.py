Demonstration script for Phase 4: Venting and Reset Mechanism

This script demonstrates the complete venting cycle for pneumatic floaters,
including automatic venting triggers, air release dynamics, water refill,
and floater reset to heavy state.

Phase 4 Features Demonstrated:
1. Automatic venting triggers (position-based, tilt-based, surface breach)
2. Air release dynamics with choked/subsonic flow
3. Water inflow calculations
4. Complete venting cycle with floater state transitions
5. Reset coordination for descent phase
