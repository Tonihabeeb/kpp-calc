Phase 1 Pneumatic System Demonstration

This script demonstrates the functionality of the newly implemented
air compression and pressure control systems from Phase 1.

It shows realistic pneumatic system behavior including:
- Air compression with energy calculations
- Pressure control with hysteresis
- Safety monitoring and fault detection
- Energy efficiency tracking
