# KPP Simulator Improvement Roadmap

Based on a thorough analysis of the project, this document outlines a roadmap for improving the KPP simulator. The roadmap is divided into four phases, each with specific goals and actionable steps.

**Phase 1: Code Cleanup and Refactoring**

*   **Goal:** Simplify the codebase, remove legacy components, and establish a clear, unified architecture.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Remove Legacy Components:** Eliminate the old `drivetrain`, `generator`, and other obsolete components from `SimulationEngine`.
    2.  **Unify State Management:** Consolidate the multiple state-retrieval methods (`get_output_data`, `get_simulation_state`, `collect_state`, `log_state`) into a single, consistent mechanism. The `state_manager` should be the sole source of truth for the simulation state.
    3.  **Refactor `SimulationEngine.step()`:** Simplify the `step` method to clearly delegate tasks to the respective managers (`component_manager`, `physics_manager`, `system_manager`, `state_manager`).
    4.  **Standardize Parameter Management:** Use the Pydantic `SimulationParams` schema exclusively for parameter validation and access, removing the legacy dictionary-based `self.params`.

**Phase 2: Improve Physics and Simulation Accuracy**

*   **Goal:** Enhance the realism and accuracy of the simulation by improving the physics models.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Integrate Chain Dynamics:** Fully integrate the `chain_system` into the `physics_manager` to accurately model chain tension, and floater interactions.
    2.  **Enhance Fluid Dynamics:** Improve the `fluid_system` to model viscosity, and other fluid properties more accurately.
    3.  **Refine Thermal Model:** Enhance the `thermal_model` to include heat transfer between components and the environment.

**Phase 3: Enhance Control and Automation**

*   **Goal:** Improve the `integrated_control_system` to enable more sophisticated control strategies and automation.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Implement Advanced Control Algorithms:** Explore and implement advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) for optimizing power output and system efficiency.
    2.  **Develop Automated Startup/Shutdown Sequences:** Create robust, fully automated startup and shutdown procedures managed by the `transient_event_controller`.
    3.  **Improve Fault Detection and Recovery:** Enhance the `integrated_control_system` with more comprehensive fault detection, diagnosis, and automated recovery mechanisms.

**Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing and Validation**

*   **Goal:** Ensure the reliability, stability, and accuracy of the simulator through rigorous testing.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Expand Unit Tests:** Increase unit test coverage for all components, managers, and physics models.
    2.  **Develop Integration Tests:** Create a suite of integration tests to validate the interactions between different parts of the simulation.
    3.  **Implement End-to-End Validation:** Develop end-to-end validation tests that simulate realistic operational scenarios and compare the results against expected outcomes or real-world data if available.
